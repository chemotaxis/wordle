# Wordle Notebook

A Jupyter notebook that helps me solve Wordle problems.

See [wordle.ipynb](wordle.ipynb) for the current solution.

## Other files

- `original.ipynb` is the first notebook solution.  Only kept for reference.
- `wordle.db` is an SQLite database that has all the solutions.
- `words_alpha.txt` is a file containing over 300,000 English words.  Wordle
  only uses five-letter words, so we use just over 15,000 of those words.
